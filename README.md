- The app allows users to perform basic math operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The app has a current screen and a previous screen to display the current value and the previous value in the calculation.
- The app includes buttons for numbers, operators, the decimal point, and the clear and delete functions.
To perform a calculation, the user can enter a number, select an operator, enter another number, and then press the equals button to see the result. The result will be displayed on the current screen and the previous calculation will be displayed on the previous screen.
- The app includes a maximum value of 100000000 and will display "Math Error" if a calculation exceeds this value.
- The app also has a delete button that allows the user to remove the last digit of the current value, and a clear button that resets all values and screens to their default state.
- The app uses DOM manipulation to access and modify elements within the HTML document, as well as factory functions to create event listeners for each button.
- The app utilizes various programming concepts such as variable assignment, conditional statements, loops, and operator usage to perform calculations and update the display.
